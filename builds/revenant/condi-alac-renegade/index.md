<Warning>

This build is mainly to be used in condition comps in (such as Sunqua Peak CM and Silent Surf CM). In power comps <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/> is strictly better due to a lot of factors such as quick burst, more support, and more versatility.

</Warning> 

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is an unique build that should only be played in condition comps, since it performs much better than <BuildLink build="Power Renegade" specialization="Renegade"/>. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a high damage output and can be pretty efficient when played properly. Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> provides <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and some <Boon name="Might"/> through <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill id="44076"/> respectively. Finally, to top it off this build has high CC capabilities with <Skill id="41220"/>, <Skill id="28409"/> and <Skill id="41820"/>.

Condi <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is pretty independent due to its rather good mobility (<Skill id="28029"/>, <Skill id="27917"/>) and permanent 25 <Boon name="Might"/> thanks to <Skill id="44076"/> and <Trait id="1781"/>.

### Orders From Above

- If you use the 80% Boon Duration build use your <Skill id="45537"/> off cooldown
- If you share <Boon name="Alacrity" /> with a <Specialization name="Specter" /> you will need to pay attention to when you will need to share. Depending on their build, you may get away with only pressing <Skill name="ordersfromabove" /> in <Skill name="legendaryrenegadestance" />, but if <Boon name="Alacrity" /> is dropping you will have to press it more regularly.
- If you use play double Renegade always use <Skill id="45537"/> during a <Skill id="41858"/> rotation

<Warning>

Do not use <Skill id="45537"/> right before a mechanic or any reason that would not let your whole party get every tick from <Skill id="45537"/> (like spreading around): you are already very tight on <Boon name="Alacrity"/>!

</Warning>



<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Specialization name="Renegade" text="Condi Renegade"/>'s rotation is similar in both raids and fractals. Ideally you want to save skills you usually use while in <Skill id="41858"/> to CC or keep skills like <Skill id="73059"/> for exposed phases.

Try to following these rules :

1.  <Skill id="41858"/> : be on Mace/Axe
2.  <Skill id="28494"/> : be on Shortbow

You'll usually want to be in <Skill id="41858"/> for exposed phases, as <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> is your best skill to damage quickly thanks to <Condition name="Burning"/>. You also want to be on <Skill id="41858"/> to be able to precast <Skill id="42949"/> for <Condition name="Bleeding"/>, and use <Skill id="41220"/> and <Skill name="Temporal Rift"/> to CC.

Right after you're done with <Skill id="41858"/> skills, swap to <Skill id="28494"/> and do the Shortbow Rotation shown below.

You will want to use <Skill id="45537"/> and <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> off cooldown/at key moments. If <Skill id="45537"/> will be off cooldown during a <Skill id="28494"/> Rotation, stop <Skill name="Embrace The Darkness"/> right before **Step 9**. If it will be off cooldown during a <Skill id="41858"/> Rotation, don't use <Skill id="40485"/>.
